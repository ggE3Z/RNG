Welcome to the RNG Downloader App! üéÆüöÄ This simple desktop app lets you download and play a fun number-guessing game on your computer. All you have to do is click a button to download the game, and then you can start playing with just another click. It‚Äôs super easy!

Features
Download the Game: Just click the ‚ÄúDownload Game‚Äù button, and the app will grab the game script for you.

Play the Game: Once the game is downloaded, the ‚ÄúPlay Game‚Äù button will appear. Click it to start the game!

Simple Interface: Built with Python‚Äôs tkinter, this app is lightweight and easy to use.
